### Thanks for joining today! ###

This workshop shows how you can build a production-scale application that uses Step Functions for orchestration, and EventBridge for choreography. You can also use a serverless approach for a range of other workloads, such as:

- Data processing
- Web and mobile applications
- Backend systems
- IT management
- Chatbots and Alexa skills

This workshop is just the beginning. Learn more about what you can build with serverless at [Serverless Land](https://serverlessland.com).
