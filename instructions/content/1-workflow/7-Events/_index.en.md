## Overview

* You will modify the workflow to emit an event if the shop is not ready to receive an order.
* You will also add an event once the order is finished.
* For timeouts, you will change the workflow to emit information about order timeouts.
* You will test the new workflow and see the input and output payloads.

After this section, you will have a workflow that emits several new events.

## 1. Emitting a time out event.

In this section, you add an EventBridge PutEvents state that emits an event if either the customer or barista times out an order. You have already created the logic to handle time outs so only need to use EventBridge to emit an event.

### Step-by-step instructions ##

1. Go to the Step Functions console. From the AWS Management Console, select *Services* then select Step Functions under *Application Integration*. **Make sure your region is correct**.

2. From the left-hand menu, select *State machine* and choose **OrderProcessorWorkflow** from the list. Choose **Edit**.

3. On the next page, choose **Workflow Studio** to open the workflow in the designer.

4. With the *Actions* tab selected on the left, enter `putevents` in the search bar. Drag the *Amazon EventBridge PutEvents* action from the list to between the *Customer timeout* and End states in the designer.

5. With the state selected, the attribute panel on the right shows the configuration for this state. In the *Configuration tab*:
- For *State name*, enter **Emit - error timeout**.
- Ensure Wait for callback is **unchecked**.
- For *API Parameters*, paste the following JSON:

```
{
  "Entries": [
    {
      "Detail": {
        "Message": "The order timed out. Step Functions waits a set amount of time (5 minutes for a customer, 15 minutes for a barista), no action was taken and so the order is ended.",
        "userId.$": "$.detail.userId",
        "orderId.$": "$.detail.orderId",
        "cause.$": "$.cause"
      },
      "DetailType": "OrderProcessor.OrderTimeOut",
      "EventBusName": "Serverlesspresso",
      "Source": "awsserverlessda.serverlesspresso"
    }
  ]
}
```

6. Connect the *Barista timeout* pass state to the *Emit - error timeout* state. Choose the *Barista timeout* state to open the the attribute panel on the right. In the *Configuration* tab, change *Next state* to *Emit - error timeout*.

## 2. Emitting an order finished event.

In this section, you add an EventBridge PutEvents state that emits an event if the shop is closed or there is no capacity to accept new orders.

### Step-by-step instructions ##

1. With the *Actions* tab selected on the left, enter `putevents` in the search bar. Drag the *Amazon EventBridge PutEvents* action from the list to between the Pass and End states in the designer.

2. With the state selected, the attribute panel on the right shows the configuration for this state. In the *Configuration tab*:
- For *State name*, enter **Emit - order finished**.
- Ensure *Wait for callback* is **unchecked**.
- For *API Parameters*, paste the following JSON:

```
{
  "Entries": [
    {
      "Detail": {
        "Message": "The order has reached the end of the workflow, and so a final event is emitted to alert other services to this.",
        "userId.$": "$.detail.userId",
        "orderId.$": "$.detail.orderId"
      },
      "DetailType": "OrderProcessor.orderFinished",
      "EventBusName": "Serverlesspresso",
      "Source": "awsserverlessda.serverlesspresso"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 3. Updating the shop not ready event.

In this section, you update the EventBridge PutEvents state that was created earlier to emit an event if the shop is closed or there is no capacity to accept new orders.

### Step-by-step instructions ##

1. Chose the *PutEvents* state between the *Shop open?* and *End* states in the designer.

![Drag UpdateItem to designer](../images/se-mod1-wait20.png)

2. With the state selected, the attribute panel on the right shows the configuration for this state. In the *Configuration tab*:
- For *State name*, enter **Emit - Shop not ready**.
- For *Wait for callback*, **uncheck** this box.
- For *API Parameters*, paste the following JSON:

```
{
  "Entries": [
    {
      "Detail": {
        "Message": "The Step functions workflow checks if the shop is open and has capacity to serve a new order by invoking a Lambda function that queries the Shop conig service. The shop was not ready, and so a 'not ready' event is emitted to cancel the current order.",
        "userId.$": "$.detail.userId"
      },
      "DetailType": "OrderProcessor.ShopUnavailable",
      "EventBusName": "Serverlesspresso",
      "Source": "awsserverlessda.serverlesspresso"
    }
  ]
}
```
