TODO

In this module you:
- Created a code repository in Cloud9 and configured Amplify Console to publish the web app in this repository. You now have a public URL endpoint for your application.
- Deployed the backend infrastructure for the theme park and application.
- Populated a DynamoDB table containing ride and attraction information for the park.
- Tested the deployment by using the CLI to scan the DynamoDB table, and using `curl` to test the API Gateway endpoint.
- Updated the front-end with this new API endpoint and saw the results in the application.
- Pushed code changes (in the form of a configuration update) to CodeCommit, and saw how Amplify Console automatically detected the new commit and published the changes to the public frontend.

In the next module, you will add realtime waiting times for the rides.
