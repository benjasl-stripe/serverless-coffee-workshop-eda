In this module you:
* You created a new workflow in [AWS Step Functions](https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/).
* You incrementally added branching logic to the workflow by using choice states.
* You used direct service integrations to interact with DynamoDB and EventBridge without needing custom code in a Lambda function.

In the next module, you will finish building out the workflow.
