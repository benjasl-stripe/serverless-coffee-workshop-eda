[AWS Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/) is a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that lets you write, run, and debug your code with just a browser. It includes a code editor, debugger, and terminal. Cloud9 comes pre-packaged with essential tools for popular programming languages and the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) pre-installed so you donâ€™t need to install files or configure your laptop for this workshop.

Your Cloud9 environment will have access to the same AWS resources as the user with which you logged into the AWS Management Console. We strongly recommend using Cloud9 to complete this workshop.

Take a few minutes now and setup your Cloud9 development environment. Cloud9 works best with Chrome or Firefox, not Safari. It cannot be used from a tablet.

## Starting AWS Cloud9 ##

### Step-by-step instructions ###

1. Go to the AWS Management Console, Select **Services** then select [**Cloud9**](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/home) under Developer Tools. From the top-right of the Console, select an available region for this workshop. Once you have selected a region for Cloud9, use the same region for the entirety of this workshop.

2. Select **Create environment**.

3. Enter `serverlesspresso-development` into **Name** and optionally provide a **Description**.

4. Select **Next step**.

5. For *Instance type*, select a **t3.small**. You may leave the other **Environment settings** at their defaults for a EC2 instance based on Amazon Linux 2 which will be paused after **30 minutes** of inactivity. Select **Next step**.

6. Review the environment settings and select **Create environment**. It will take a few minutes for your Cloud9 environment to be provisioned and prepared.

7. Once ready, your IDE will open to a welcome screen. Below that, you should see a terminal prompt. Close the *Welcome* tab and drag up the terminal window to give yourself more space to work in.

You can run AWS CLI commands in here just like you would on your local computer. Remember for this workshop to run all commands within the Cloud9 terminal window instead of your local computer.

Keep your AWS Cloud9 IDE opened in a browser tab throughout this workshop.

8. Verify that your user is logged in by running the command `aws sts get-caller-identity`. Copy and paste the command into the Cloud9 terminal window.

```console
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

You'll see output indicating your account and user information:

```json
{
    "Account": "123456789012",
    "UserId": "AKIAI44QH8DHBEXAMPLE",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/Roxie"
}
```
9. Check the current AWS Region to make sure you are running the workshop in a supported Region.

Run these commands in the Cloud9 terminal window:
```bash
AWS_REGION=$(curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/placement/availability-zone | sed 's/\(.*\)[a-z]/\1/')
SUPPORTED_REGIONS=("us-west-2" "us-east-1" "us-east-2" "eu-central-1" "eu-west-1" "ap-southeast-2" "sa-east-1" "ap-northeast-1")

if [[ ! " ${SUPPORTED_REGIONS[@]} " =~ " ${AWS_REGION} " ]]; then
    /bin/echo -e "\e[1;31m'$AWS_REGION' is not a supported AWS Region, delete this Cloud9 instance and restart the workshop in a supported AWS Region.\e[0m"
else
    /bin/echo -e "\e[1;32m'$AWS_REGION' is a supported AWS Region\e[0m"
fi
```
Make sure the response confirms your Region is supported.

10. Next, install JQ to provide formatting for JSON in the console:

```
sudo yum install jq -y
```

Keep an open scratch pad in Cloud9 or a text editor on your local computer for notes. When the step-by-step directions tell you to note something such as
an ID or Amazon Resource Name (ARN), copy and paste that into your scratch pad.
