In this workshop, you will deploy a [serverless](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/) backend that supports a pop-up coffee shop. You will then test your application using 3 front-end applications that are provided.

At this event, your instructor will provide an overview of the steps involved. There are AWS employees available to help with any of your questions - don't be afraid to ask if you get stuck!

To get started, follow the module headings on the left, starting with [Introduction](./0-introduction.html).
