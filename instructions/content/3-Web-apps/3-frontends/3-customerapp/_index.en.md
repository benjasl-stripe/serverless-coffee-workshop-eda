The Customer App runs on customers' smartphones. When they first scan the QR code using a smartphone, the URL redirects the browser to this web app.

## Setting up the Customer App

### Step-by-step instructions ###

1. You can transfer the configuration from the Display App to avoid typing the settings manually on your smartphone. If you have configured the Display App, switch to that tab in your browser, or navigate to https://workshop-display.serverlesscoffee.com/. Choose the **Configure order app** button in the toolbar.

3. On your smartphone, use the barcode scanner app to scan this QR code. This opens the configuration settings page and populates the fields with the backend settings.
