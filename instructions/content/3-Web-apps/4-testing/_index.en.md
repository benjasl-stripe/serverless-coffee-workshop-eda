It's time to complete a full end-to-end test with the front-end application using your smartphone - this step requires the use of an iPhone or Android device.

## Ordering a drink with the customer app

### Step-by-step instructions ###

1. Ensure that the [Display App](https://workshop-display.serverlesscoffee.com/) and [Barista App](https://workshop-barista.serverlesscoffee.com/) are open in two separate browser tabs.

- The Display App powers a display above the coffee bar.
- The Barista App powers a tablet used by the barista.

2. Open the barcode scanner on your smartphone. Some phone models may require the use of a free QR scanner app instead of the default barcode scanner. Scan the QR code on the Display App. If a barcode isn't currently shown because the screen is in a timeout period, wait until the timer counter ends and the barcode reappears.

3. Sign into the app using the account you created in a previous section.

6. Interact with the Barista app to *Make* or *Cancel* the drink and note how the Display and Customers apps are updated.

7. Repeat steps 2-6 to place additional orders and experiment with the application's functionality. You can also navigate to the Step Functions console to see the workflows for each coffee drink.

### Next steps

**Congratulations!** You have completed an end-to-end backend test for the Serverlesspresso application. If you have time remaining in the workshop, complete the optional module to add a new microservice to the app that creates a Coffee Journey report for each customer.
