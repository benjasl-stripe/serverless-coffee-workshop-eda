## Overview

The `WaitingCompletion` event is emitted by the `OrderProcessor` workflow built in module 1. At this point in the order, the user has submitted their drink request, the `OrderProcessor` workflow has generated an order number, and is now paused until the barista completes the order. The workflow has emitted a `WaitingCompletion` event, along with a new `TaskTaken` which is used to resume the workflow.

You will now create a new rule to route this event to a Lambda function that will update the `serverlesspresso-order-table` with the new `TaskToken`, order number, and order state.

6. In Step 4 of the wizard, choose **Next**.

7. In Step 5 of the wizard, check that the *Define rule detail* panel that the *Event bus* is `Serverlesspresso`. Choose **Create rule**.

## Review the list of rules

In this section, you created 4 EventBridge rules on the Serverlesspresso event bus. On the *Rules* page, change the *Event bus* dropdown to `Serverlesspresso` and verify that you see all 4 new rules listed (in addition to the 4 rules created in the setup process).

If you created a rule on the default bus instead, review the previous steps in this module to add the rules to the custom bus.
