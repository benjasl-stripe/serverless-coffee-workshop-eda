## Overview

The Order Processor workflow built in module emits the `WorkflowStarted` event. At this point in the order, the workflow has checked that the shop is open and that the barista has capacity for the new order. The workflow now waits for up to 5 minutes for the customer to choose and submit their coffee order. This is the first time in the process that the order waits for human interaction.

Step functions does this by implementing the *Wait for callback Task Token* patern. It passes the task token to the integrated service ([Amazon EventBridge](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge)). The task pauses until the workflow receives that task token back with a `SendTaskSuccess` or `SendTaskFailure` call.

In the next step you create the rule that recieves the `WorkflowStarted` event containing the task token. You route this event to an [AWS Lambda Function](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) which persists the token to an [AWS DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) table, along with the unique order ID.

The Order Manager service keeps tracks of all the individual drink orders (e.g. "Double espresso") and their completion status. The service is used by the Barista and Customer Apps to fetch lists of open or completed orders. This service is kept in sync by listening to events from the workflow.

In this section:

* You will create a new rule in [Amazon EventBridge](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/).
* You will configure the new rule to invoke an [AWS Lambda Function](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/).
* You will test the new rule and see the Lambda function input payload and response.

## Creating the Workflow Started rule
### Step-by-step instructions ##

1. Go to the EventBridge console. From the AWS Management Console, select *Services* then select EventBridge in *Application Integration*. **Make sure your region is correct**.

2. Choose **Rules**. Select the event bus named **Serverlesspresso**. Choose **Create rule**.

3. For the Name, enter *WorkflowStarted*.

4. Choose **Custom pattern**. Copy and paste the following into the *Event Pattern* section:
```
{
  "detail-type": ["OrderProcessor.WorkflowStarted"],
  "source": ["awsserverlessda.serverlesspresso"]
}
```

5. Choose **Save**.

6. In the *Select targets* section, select *Lambda function* in the first dropdown. In the *Function* dropdown, choose the Lambda function containing the name `WorkflowStarted`  from the *Function* dropdown. This was deployed by the core stack in the setup module. Tip: you can start typing "WorkflowStarted" into field to find the function.

7. Choose **Create**. The new rule appears in the *Rules* panel.

## Testing the "WorkflowStarted" EventBridge rule

In this section, you will test that the rule invokes the *WorkflowStarted* Lambda function, and inspect the event payload and results.

### Step-by-step instructions ###

To start a new workflow:

1. From the [AWS Cloud 9](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloud9) terminal, run the following AWS CLI command. This emits a `NewOrder` event to the `Serverlesspresso` event bus that starts the `OrderProcessor` workflow:
```
aws events put-events --entries '[{"Source":"awsserverlessda.serverlesspresso", "DetailType":"Validator.NewOrder", "EventBusName":"Serverlesspresso", "Detail": "{\"userId\":\"1\",\"orderId\":\"1\"}"}]'

```

![CLI command](../images/se-mod2-workflowStarted8.png)

The rule you created called *NewOrder* triggers the `OrderProcessor` workflow. This in turn sends a `WorkflowStarted` event to the *Serverlesspresso event bus*.

2. Go to the [CloudWatch console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home). From the AWS Management Console, select *Services* then select CloudWatch in *Management & Governance*. **Make sure your region is correct**.

3. From the left menu, choose **Log groups**. Choose the log group called `/aws/events/serverlesspressoEventBus`.

4. The two most recent log streams shown contain the two events.

5. Choose the most recent log stream to show the detail and expand the arrow next to the *Timestamp* column. This shows the `OrderProcessor.WorkflowStarted` event that was processed by the event bus.

This shows all the event information, including the `TaskToken` generated by Step Functions, the event `detail-type`, and the event's `source`.

6. The new *WorkflowStarted* rule has routed this event to the *WorkflowStarted* Lambda function. This Lambda function writes the task token to a DynamoDB table named *serverlesspresso-order-table*.

7. Go to the [DynamoDB console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/home). From the AWS Management Console, select *Services* then select DynamoDB in *Database*. **Make sure your region is correct**.

8. Select *Explore items* in the *Tables* menu on the left. Select the table `serverlesspresso-order-table`.

![DynamoDB table](../images/se-mod2-workflowStarted11.png)

9. In the *Items returned* panel, choose the first item to view its contents. The order was written to the DynamoDB table by the Lambda function. The item contains the Step Functions `TaskToken`, the Order ID ("SK"), and the "ORDERSTATE":

![Item content](../images/se-mod2-workflowStarted12.png)

When the customer submits the drink order from the Customer App, the Order Manager microservice will fetch this task token from DynamoDB and return it to the Step Functions service. This will then be use to resume the workflow for that order.

In the next section you will see how orders are cancelled, updated, and completed by a seperate workflow called the *OrderManager*

### Recap

- You created a new rule to invoke a Lambda function that writes order information to a DynamoDB table.
- You tested by mocking an event from the CLI, observing the events processed by the custom event bus, and verifying that the order information is written to the DynamoDB table.

### Next steps

Congratulations! You have configured rules to process events and deliver selected events to different targets. This connects backend microservices together when events occur throughout the workload. In the next section, you will use the three frontend applications to test the backend.
